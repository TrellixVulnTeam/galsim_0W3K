Description: simulating images of astronomical objects
 GalSim is open-source software for simulating images of astronomical objects
 (stars, galaxies) in a variety of ways. The bulk of the calculations are
 carried out in C++, and the user interface is in python. In addition, the
 code can operate directly on "config" files, for those users who prefer not
 to work in python

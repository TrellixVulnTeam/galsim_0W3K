class AtmosphericScreen(object):
    """ An atmospheric phase screen that can drift in the wind and evolves ("boils") over time.  The
    initial phases and fractional phase updates are drawn from a von Karman power spectrum, which is
    defined by a Fried parameter that effectively sets the amplitude of the turbulence, and an outer
    scale beyond which the turbulence power flattens.

    @param screen_size   Physical extent of square phase screen in meters.  This should be large
                         enough to accommodate the desired field-of-view of the telescope as well as
                         the meta-pupil defined by the wind speed and exposure time.  Note that
                         the screen will have periodic boundary conditions, so while the code will
                         still run with a small screen, this may introduce artifacts into PSFs or
                         PSF correlation functions.  Also note that screen_size may be tweaked by
                         the initializer to ensure `screen_size` is a multiple of `screen_scale`.
    @param screen_scale  Physical pixel scale of phase screen in meters.  An order unity multiple of
                         the Fried parameter is usually sufficiently small, but users should test
                         the effects of varying this parameter to ensure robust results.
                         [default: r0_500]
    @param altitude      Altitude of phase screen in km.  This is with respect to the telescope, not
                         sea-level.  [default: 0.0]
    @param r0_500        Fried parameter setting the amplitude of turbulence; contributes to "size"
                         of the resulting atmospheric PSF.  Specified at wavelength 500 nm, in units
                         of meters.  [default: 0.2]
    @param L0            Outer scale in meters.  The turbulence power spectrum will smoothly
                         approach a constant at scales larger than L0.  Set to `None` or `np.inf`
                         for a power spectrum without an outer scale.  [default: 25.0]
    @param vx            x-component wind velocity in meters/second.  [default: 0.]
    @param vy            y-component wind velocity in meters/second.  [default: 0.]
    @param alpha         Square root of fraction of phase that is "remembered" between time_steps
                         (i.e., alpha**2 is the fraction remembered). The fraction sqrt(1-alpha**2)
                         is then the amount of turbulence freshly generated in each step.  Setting
                         alpha=1.0 results in a frozen-flow atmosphere.  Note that computing PSFs
                         from frozen-flow atmospheres may be significantly faster than computing
                         PSFs with non-frozen-flow atmospheres.  If `alpha` != 1.0, then it is
                         required that a `time_step` is also specified.  [default: 1.0]
    @param time_step     Time interval between phase boiling updates.  Note that this is distinct
                         from the time interval used to integrate the PSF over time, which is set
                         by the `time_step` keyword argument to `PhaseScreenPSF` or
                         `PhaseScreenList.makePSF`.  If `time_step` is not None, then it is required
                         that `alpha` is set to something other than 1.0.  [default: None]
    @param rng           Random number generator as a galsim.BaseDeviate().  If None, then use the
                         clock time or system entropy to seed a new generator.  [default: None]

    spectrum.  Specifically, the phase power spectrum in each screen can be written

    psi(nu) = 0.023 r0^(-5/3) (nu^2 + 1/L0^2)^(11/6)

    where psi(nu) is the power spectral density at spatial frequency nu, r0 is the Fried parameter
    (which has dimensions of length) and sets the amplitude of the turbulence, and L0 is the outer
    scale (also dimensions of length) beyond which the power asymptotically flattens.  Typical
    values for r0 are ~0.1 to 0.2 meters, which corresponds roughly to PSF FWHMs of ~0.5 to 1.0
    arcsec for optical wavelengths.  Note that r0 is a function of wavelength, scaling like
    r0 ~ wavelength^(6/5).  To reduce confusion, the input parameter here is named r0_500 and refers
    explicitly to the Fried parameter at a wavelength of 500 nm.  The outer scale is typically in
    the 10s of meters and does not vary with wavelength.

    To create multiple layers, simply specify keyword arguments as length-N lists instead of scalars
    (works for all arguments except `rng`).  If, for any of these keyword arguments, you want to use
    the same value for each layer, then you can just specify the argument as a scalar and the
    function will automatically broadcast it into a list with length equal to the longest found
    keyword argument list.  Note that it is an error to specify keywords with lists of different
    lengths (unless only one of them has length > 1).

    The one exception to the above is the keyword `r0_500`.  The effective Fried parameter for a set
    of atmospheric layers is r0_500_effective = (sum(r**(-5./3) for r in r0_500s))**(-3./5).
    Providing `r0_500` as a scalar or single-element list will result in broadcasting such that the
    effective Fried parameter for the whole set of layers equals the input argument.  You can weight
    the contribution of each layer with the `r0_weights` keyword.

    As an example, the following code approximately creates the atmosphere used by Jee+Tyson(2011)
    for their study of atmospheric PSFs for LSST.  Note this code takes about ~2 minutes to run on
    a fast laptop, and will consume about (8192**2 pixels) * (8 bytes) * (6 screens) ~ 3 GB of
    RAM in its final state, and more at intermediate states.

        >>> altitude = [0, 2.58, 5.16, 7.73, 12.89, 15.46]  # km
        >>> r0_500 = 0.16  # m
        >>> weights = [0.652, 0.172, 0.055, 0.025, 0.074, 0.022]
        >>> speed = np.random.uniform(0, 20, size=6)  # m/s
        >>> direction = [np.random.uniform(0, 360)*galsim.degrees for i in xrange(6)]
        >>> npix = 8192
        >>> screen_scale = r0_500
        >>> atm = galsim.Atmosphere(r0_500=r0_500, r0_weights=weights,
                                    screen_size=screen_scale*npix,
                                    altitude=altitude, L0=25.0, speed=speed,
                                    direction=direction, screen_scale=screen_scale)

    Once the atmosphere is constructed, a 15-sec exposure length, 5ms time step, monochromatic PSF
    at 700nm (using an 8.4 meter aperture, 0.6 fractional obscuration and otherwise default
    settings) takes about 7 minutes to draw on a fast laptop.

        >>> psf = atm.makePSF(lam=700.0, exptime=15.0, time_step=0.005, diam=8.4, obscuration=0.6)
        >>> img1 = psf.drawImage()  # ~7 min

    The same psf, if drawn using photon-shooting on the same laptop, will generate photons at a rate
    of about 1 million per second.

        >>> img2 = psf.drawImage(nx=32, ny=32, scale=0.2, method='phot', n_photons=1e6)  # ~1 sec.

    Note that the Fourier-based calculation compute time will scale linearly with exposure time,
    while the photon-shooting calculation compute time will scale linearly with the number of
    photons being shot.

    Many factors will affect the timing of results, of course, including aperture diameter, gsparams
    settings, pad_factor and oversampling options to makePSF, time_step and exposure time, frozen
    vs. non-frozen atmospheric layers, and so on.  We recommend that users try varying these
    settings to find a balance of speed and fidelity.

    @param r0_500        Fried parameter setting the amplitude of turbulence; contributes to "size"
                         of the resulting atmospheric PSF.  Specified at wavelength 500 nm, in units
                         of meters.  [default: 0.2]
    @param r0_weights    Weights for splitting up the contribution of r0_500 between different
                         layers.  Note that this keyword is only allowed if r0_500 is either a
                         scalar or a single-element list.  [default: None]
    @param screen_size   Physical extent of square phase screen in meters.  This should be large
                         enough to accommodate the desired field-of-view of the telescope as well as
                         the meta-pupil defined by the wind speed and exposure time.  Note that
                         the screen will have periodic boundary conditions, so the code will run
                         with a smaller sized screen, though this may introduce artifacts into PSFs
                         or PSF correlation functions. Note that screen_size may be tweaked by the
                         initializer to ensure screen_size is a multiple of screen_scale.
    @param screen_scale  Physical pixel scale of phase screen in meters.  A fraction of the Fried
                         parameter is usually sufficiently small, but users should test the effects
                         of this parameter to ensure robust results.
                         [default: same as each screen's r0_500]
    @param altitude      Altitude of phase screen in km.  This is with respect to the telescope, not
                         sea-level.  [default: 0.0]
    @param L0            Outer scale in meters.  The turbulence power spectrum will smoothly
                         approach a constant at scales larger than L0.  Set to `None` or `np.inf`
                         for a power spectrum without an outer scale.  [default: 25.0]
    @param speed         Wind speed in meters/second.  [default: 0.0]
    @param direction     Wind direction as galsim.Angle [default: 0.0 * galsim.degrees]
    @param alpha         Square root of fraction of phase that is "remembered" between time_steps
                         (i.e., alpha**2 is the fraction remembered). The fraction sqrt(1-alpha**2)
                         is then the amount of turbulence freshly generated in each step.  Setting
                         alpha=1.0 results in a frozen-flow atmosphere.  Note that computing PSFs
                         from frozen-flow atmospheres may be significantly faster than computing
                         PSFs with non-frozen-flow atmospheres.  [default: 1.0]
    @param time_step     Time interval between phase boiling updates.  Note that this is distinct
                         from the time interval used when integrating the PSF over time, which is
                         set by the `time_step` keyword argument to `PhaseScreenPSF` or
                         `PhaseScreenList.makePSF`.  If `time_step` is not None, then it is required
                         that `alpha` is set to something other than 1.0.  [default: None]
    @param rng           Random number generator as a galsim.BaseDeviate().  If None, then use the
                         clock time or system entropy to seed a new generator.  [default: None]
